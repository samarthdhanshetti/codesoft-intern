# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning techniques. 
It helps identify suspicious transactions and reduces financial loss by classifying transactions as genuine or fraudulent.

## Features
- Handles highly imbalanced datasets
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Machine Learning model training
- Fraud prediction and evaluation

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset
- Records: European cardholders transactions
- Target variable: Class (0 = Genuine, 1 = Fraud)

## Workflow
1. Load and explore dataset
2. Handle missing values and imbalance
3. Feature scaling
4. Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
5. Model evaluation
6. Fraud prediction

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git

2. Install dependencies  
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the script  
   python fraud_detection.py

## Results
- High accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions
- Reduced false positives using proper evaluation metrics

## Future Enhancements
- Use deep learning models
- Real-time fraud detection system
- Deploy using Flask or Streamlit
